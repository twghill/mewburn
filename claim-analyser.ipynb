    "# Claim Analyser\n",
    "\n",
    "Version: Beta 0.1 / 30 January 2022\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of this tool allows a user to define a claim set and view a list of valid claim combinations. The second part of this tool allows a user to define a new independent claim consisting of a valid combination of original claims and view a list of new proper dependent claims. As with any computer based analysis tool, the old adage \"garbage in, garbage out\" remains true so please make sure you have entered your input data correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool is written in Python and runs in a Jupyter notebook. All code is visible for inspection by the user. Code is written in cells that may be modified by the user. A cell can be run by selecting it with the cursor and clicking the run button in the toolbar denoted by a play button or via the key combination 'ctrl' + 'enter'. Data is shared between cells so they must be run in chronilogical order. This is important when data is modified by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "For descriptive purposes the following definitions are introduced:\n",
    "- Proper dependent claim - a dependent claim that makes dependent reference to a single claim\n",
    "- Semi-proper dependent claim - a dependent claim that makes valid dependent reference to multiple claims where any referenced dependent claims are proper dependent claims\n",
    "- Improper dependent claim - a dependent claim that makes valid dependent reference to multiple claims where at least one of the referenced claims is a semi-proper dependent claim\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Examples of \"valid dependent reference\" include \"according to any one of\" and \"or\" implicitly used in its exclusive form."

    "In the cell directly below, the user must define the claim set. Claims are written in a list format with the first element denoting the claim number and any subsequent elements defining the one or more claims the claim is dependent on. The first claim must be the only independent claim. After each claim is defined, all the claims are combined into a claim set for analysis. Once you have defined the claims, make sure to run the cell."
